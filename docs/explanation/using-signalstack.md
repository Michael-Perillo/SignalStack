# Using SignalStack

## The SignalStack Mindset

SignalStack encourages you to think systematically about your career data. Instead of scrambling to create a resume from scratch for each application, you maintain a rich repository of information that can be strategically deployed.

The core mindset shift is **separation of concerns**:
- **Collection** is separate from **application**
- **Objective data** is separate from **interpretive context**
- **Your complete history** is separate from **what you choose to present**

## General Strategy

### Data Collection Approach

Build your SignalStack incrementally rather than all at once. Consider these broad strategies:

- **Ongoing capture**: Add new facts and narratives as they happen
- **Periodic reflection**: Regular sessions to add narratives and update existing facts
- **Application-driven expansion**: Fill gaps when preparing for specific opportunities

### Organization Principles

Your SignalStack should support both **breadth** (comprehensive coverage) and **depth** (rich detail where it matters):

- Maintain comprehensive facts even for older or less relevant experiences
- Develop detailed narratives for your most significant achievements
- Create playbooks that encode your learning about what works for different contexts

## Application Approach

### Strategic Thinking About Opportunities

Each application represents a chance to test and refine your approach:

- **Pattern recognition**: Notice which types of roles respond to which presentations
- **Playbook development**: Codify successful approaches for reuse
- **Portfolio evolution**: Let successful applications inform future strategy

### Signal Package Development

Think of each application as requiring a **signal package**—a coordinated set of materials:

- **Core signals**: Resume, cover letter, portfolio links
- **Supporting materials**: References, work samples, case studies
- **Adaptation strategy**: How you'll modify your approach based on response

## Strategic Flexibility

### Playbook vs. Application-Driven Approaches

Two complementary strategies for managing multiple opportunities:

**Playbook-driven**: Develop standard approaches for types of roles (e.g., "senior engineering at startups," "consulting roles," "remote-first companies")

**Application-driven**: Customize extensively for specific high-priority opportunities

Most professionals benefit from a hybrid approach—playbooks for efficiency, custom work for key opportunities.

### Evolution and Learning

Your SignalStack should evolve based on real-world feedback:

- **Success patterns**: What presentations lead to interviews and offers?
- **Market feedback**: How do different industries/roles respond to your materials?
- **Personal growth**: How do your priorities and positioning change over time?

The goal is not perfection but **strategic iteration**—each application cycle should improve your approach.
