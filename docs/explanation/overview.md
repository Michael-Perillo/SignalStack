# SignalStack

## Problem

Professionals accumulate jobs, skills, projects, certifications and experiences over years. Yet most career management tools flatten this rich history into a single static resume. That leads to several problems:

- **Facts** get lost or overwritten when tailoring resumes for different applications
- **Narratives** (stories, case studies and reflections) aren't captured or reused
- **Tailoring logic** becomes ad hoc and fragile, rather than codified
- **Final outputs** (resumes, CVs, portfolios) are inconsistently formatted

To address these issues, SignalStack separates **Facts**, **Narratives**, **Playbooks** and **Signals**—similar in spirit to the *Diátaxis framework* for documentation. Each part has a distinct purpose, ensuring clear separation of concerns and a repeatable system for producing career artifacts.

## Mission & Scope

The mission of SignalStack is to enable professionals to collect, interpret, tailor and present their achievements in a way that is sustainable, adaptable across contexts, and aligned with modern resume best practices—such as using measurable outcomes, action verbs and **ATS-friendly** layouts.

### What's covered

- Capturing objective **facts** (jobs, education, skills, metrics)
- Writing explanatory **narratives** (case studies, reflections)
- Designing **playbooks** (rules for tailoring data to a specific goal)
- Producing **signals** (final deliverables like resumes, CVs, portfolios)

### What's not covered

SignalStack is **not** a job-search automation tool. It doesn't handle interview prep, salary negotiation or networking. It also doesn't prescribe specific software, database design or UI decisions; those are implementation details left up to you.

## The Matrix

SignalStack uses two axes—**Objective vs Interpretive** and **Raw vs Applied**—to create a four-cell matrix. Each cell corresponds to one quadrant:

> For a detailed explanation of the matrix structure, see **[The Matrix](../reference/the-matrix.md)**

|                    | **Objective (Factual)**                    | **Interpretive (Narrative)**               |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Raw (Collected)** | [**Facts**](../reference/facts.md) *(Seeds & Plants)*   | [**Narratives**](../reference/narratives.md) *(Soil & Growth Stories)* |
| **Applied (Tailored)** | [**Playbooks**](../reference/playbooks.md) *(Recipes)*  | [**Signals**](../reference/signals.md) *(Dishes Served)* |

At the end of each quadrant page you'll see the garden & harvest analogy: **Facts** are the seeds & plants; **Narratives** enrich the soil; **Playbooks** are the recipes; and **Signals** are the dishes served.
