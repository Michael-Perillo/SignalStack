# Facts *(Seeds & Plants)*

## Definition

**Facts** are the objective, canonical data about your professional life—jobs held, titles, dates, employers, education, certifications,
skills and measurable achievements. They are collected and maintained without interpretation or filtering.

Examples include:

- **Employment**: company name, job title, start and end dates, location
- **Achievements**: quantified outcomes such as "reduced API latency by 38%," "managed a team of 5 engineers"
- **Education**: degrees, institutions, majors, GPA
- **Skills & Certifications**: programming languages, technologies, professional certificates

## Best Practices

- Record each fact in a structured way (e.g. YAML, CSV or a database) so nothing gets overwritten
- Use strong action verbs and include quantifiable results when recording achievements
- Keep the reverse-chronological order by default for employment histories
- Assign skills to each fact to aid filtering and tailoring
- Ensure data is accurate and up to date; inaccurate facts undermine credibility

## Quality Checks

- Does each achievement use an action verb and, where possible, a measurable outcome?
- Are dates complete and consistent (no unexplained overlaps or gaps)?
- Are titles and company names spelled correctly?
- Are skills drawn from a controlled vocabulary or taxonomy?

## Analogy

In our garden & harvest analogy, **facts** are the **seeds and plants**—the raw ingredients you grow over the course of your career.
They need to be planted, labeled and cared for so they can later be combined into delicious dishes.
