# Narratives

## Definition

**Narratives** provide interpretive context around your facts. They explain why a project mattered, how you approached challenges and what you
learned. Narratives can take many forms:

- **STAR Stories** (Situation–Task–Action–Result) for interview preparation
- **Case Studies** summarising major projects or leadership experiences
- **Lessons Learned** essays reflecting on a degree program or certification
- **Design Docs and Postmortems** capturing thought processes and trade-offs

These narratives live alongside facts but are not meant to appear verbatim in a one-page resume. Instead, they inform and enrich your bullet
points and portfolio pages.

## Education Example

- **Narrative**: "During my senior year at XYZ University, I led a capstone project that designed a scalable chat application.
  Through weekly usability tests we discovered bottlenecks in our websocket implementation and eventually reduced latency by 50%.
  The experience taught me the value of iterative feedback and user-centred design."

## Best Practices

- Anchor narratives in facts: cite roles, dates and projects
- Use the **STAR method**: describe the context *(Situation)*, your responsibility *(Task)*, what you did *(Action)* and the impact *(Result)*
- Include links to evidence (e.g. GitHub repos, blog posts, presentations)
- Keep narratives concise—1–2 pages per story—and maintain them as living documents

## Quality Checks

- Does the narrative clearly connect to at least one fact?
- Are outcomes measurable and linked to the result?
- Are the lessons or reflections explicit?

## Analogy

In the garden & harvest analogy, **narratives** are the **soil and growth stories**—they nourish your seeds and record how your plants
matured. Good **soil** *(context)* helps **seeds** *(facts)* flourish and ensures your harvest will be flavourful.
