# Framework Matrix

SignalStack uses two orthogonal axes—**Objective ↔ Interpretive** and **Raw ↔ Applied**—to categorise every piece of career information and activity.

|                    | **Objective (Factual)**                                          | **Interpretive (Narrative)**                                           |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Raw (Collected)** | **Facts**: job titles, dates, metrics, skills, education | **Narratives**: case studies, STAR stories, lessons learned |
| **Applied (Tailored)** | **Playbooks**: rules and filters for tailoring facts to a role (keywords, recency, metrics) | **Signals**: final outputs such as resumes, CVs, portfolio pages, cover letters |

## Example: How Education Crosses the Matrix

- **Facts**: record of your degree (institution, major, dates, GPA)
- **Narratives**: a story about a capstone project or transformative class
- **Playbooks**: rules about when to include GPA or coursework
- **Signals**: how the degree appears on a resume, CV or portfolio

## Quality & Best Practice Reminders

Across all quadrants:

- Anchor achievements in measurable outcomes and strong action verbs
- Keep a master record of every fact; never edit facts directly when tailoring
- Use **ATS-friendly** structure and keywords in your signals
- Maintain narrative documents as a source of stories for interviews and portfolios

## Analogy

Like a well-tended garden, your career data grows from **seeds** *(facts)* in **soil** *(narratives)*.
**Recipes** *(playbooks)* tell you how to harvest and combine your ingredients, and **dishes** *(signals)* are what you serve to others.
This matrix helps you navigate the journey from planting to plating.
