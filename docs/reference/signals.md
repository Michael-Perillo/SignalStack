# Signals

## Definition

**Signals** are the delivered artifacts that you send to employers, collaborators or platforms: resumes, CVs, cover letters, portfolio pages,
LinkedIn summaries and bios. They are composed from facts via playbooks and informed by narratives.

Common signal types include:

- **Resume**: a one- or two-page document emphasising recent, relevant achievements. Should use clear sections, strong action verbs,
  quantified results and reverse-chronological order
- **CV (Curriculum Vitae)**: a comprehensive record of your professional and academic history, often used in academia and research
- **Portfolio Page**: a web page or PDF highlighting projects or case studies (links to narratives)
- **Cover Letter or Intro Note**: a tailored letter explaining why you are a good fit for a role, referencing both facts and narratives

## Education Example

- **Resume**: "B.S. Computer Science, XYZ University, 2020." *(facts)*
- **CV**: expanded with honours, coursework, research assistantships
- **Portfolio**: link to the capstone project page in your portfolio *(narratives)*
- **Cover Letter**: briefly mention how your degree prepared you for the target role, leaning on your narratives where needed

## Best Practices

- Use clean, minimalistic layouts with descriptive headings and white space
- Save resumes as PDF or DOCX; avoid tables or graphics that confuse **Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS)**
- Start each bullet with a strong action verb and quantify results where possible
- Tailor keywords to each job; include required skills and technologies
- Maintain consistent typography and section ordering; follow reverse-chronological format unless the playbook dictates otherwise

## Quality Checks

- Is the document **ATS-friendly** (plain text behind the scenes, no images for core content, simple fonts)?
- Are keywords aligned with the job posting?
- Does the layout guide the reader's eye (white space, headings, bullet lists)?
- Do the bullets emphasise quantifiable outcomes?

## Analogy

In the garden & harvest analogy, **signals** are the **dishes served**. They are the beautifully plated meals prepared from your ingredients
and recipesâ€”resumes, CVs, cover letters and portfolio pages that nourish your audience.
